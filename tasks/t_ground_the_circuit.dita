  <title>Ground the Circuit</title>
  <shortdesc> Soldering the ground wires to the pots and output jack. </shortdesc>
  <taskbody>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>Use one of the following methods to Lug 1 of the volume pot.</cmd>
        <choices>
          <choice>Solder the fully-stripped 0.5 inch solid core wire from Lug 1 of the volume pot
            straight back to the volume pot casing. <note type="warning">Depending on the size of
            the pots you have, 0.5 inches may be too large. If the wire is too large, you again risk
            breakage or a cold solder connection that will nullify the grounding.</note>
          </choice>
          <choice>Bend Lug 1 of the volume pot back and solder it directly to the casing, which is
            far more time and space efficient. <note type="warning">I do not recommend using this
            unless you are confident in your soldering abilities.</note>

      <step>
        <cmd>Solder one of the black wires you previously cut from the volume pot casing to the tone
          pot casing.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Solder the final black wire from the casing of the volume pot to the Sleeve of the
          output jack.</cmd>
        <info>The Sleeve of the output jack is the larger inner-most lug.</info>
