          If the circuit produces sound with a direct connection, it's a problem with the pots.

      <step>
        <cmd>
          If the problem persists after soldering a direct connection, solder a different humbucker to the output jack.
        </cmd>
        <stepresult>
          If the circuit produces sound, it's a faulty humbucker. If the problem persists, it's a faulty output jack and you need to replace it.
