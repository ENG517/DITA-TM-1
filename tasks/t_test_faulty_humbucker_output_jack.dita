  <title>Identify Faulty Humbucker or Output Jack</title>
  <shortdesc>
    Determine whether a faulty humbucker or output jack is causing signal loss by testing them in isolation.

  <taskbody>
    <prereq>
      <p>
        You need a soldering iron heated to 650-700°F, desoldering wick or pump, and a spare humbucker for testing.
      </p>
    </prereq>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>
          Desolder the humbucker from the potentiometers.
        </cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>
          Disconnect the wires from the output jack.
        </cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>
          Solder the humbucker directly to the output jack.
        </cmd>

          <ul>
            <li>Hot wire connects to the tip Lug.</li>
            <li>Ground wire connects to the sleeve Lug.</li>

      <step>
        <cmd>
          Plug in your guitar and test for sound.
        </cmd>
        <stepresult>
          If the guitar produces sound, the potentiometers are faulty. If no sound, continue to the next step.
        </stepresult>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>
          Desolder the original humbucker and solder a different humbucker to the output jack.
        </cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>
          Test for sound again.
        </cmd>
        <stepresult>
          If the guitar produces sound, the original humbucker is faulty. If no sound, the output jack is faulty.
        </stepresult>
