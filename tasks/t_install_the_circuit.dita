        <cmd>While not pictured in the diagram, your guitar body should have a wire running from one
          of the bridge peg slots into the electronics cavity. Solder the end of that wire (in the
          electronics cavity) to the volume pot casing.</cmd>
        <info>If your guitar body does not have this wire, perform the following substeps to create
          one.</info>
