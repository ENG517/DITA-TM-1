  <shortdesc>Determine if the output jack is faulty by testing with a different humbucker</shortdesc>
  <taskbody>
    <prereq>
      <p>You should have already tested the humbucker with a direct connection to the output jack and confirmed that the problem persists.</p>
    </prereq>
    <context>
      <p>If weak or no sound continues after connecting the humbucker directly to the output jack, either the humbucker or the output jack is faulty.</p>

        <cmd>Solder a different humbucker to the output jack.</cmd>
        <choices>
          <choice>If the circuit produces sound, it's a faulty humbucker and needs to be replaced</choice>
