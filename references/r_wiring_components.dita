      <title>Potentiometers</title>
      <p>A potentiometer (often referred to as a pot) is a type of rotating resistor that will control your guitar's tone and volume. They are what you will be soldering on, so it's important to get acquainted with their parts.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Lug 2:</b> Connected to the carbon track, lug 2 is a type of resistant wiper (think windshield) that controls the amount of electrical current diverted to the outer lugs (Lugs 1 and 3). Turning the knob left will divert the current to lug 1 while turning the knob right will divert the current to lug 3.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Lugs 1 and 3:</b> Serve different functions across the volume and tone pots, so the important thing to remember is one will receive current and one will not.

      <title>Hot Wires and Ground Wires</title>
      <p>
        In guitar wiring, there are two types of wires: hot wires and ground wires. Hot wires carry the electrical signal from the pickups to the output jack, while ground wires provide a return path for the electrical current and help reduce noise and interference.
