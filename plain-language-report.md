We applied plain language principles across our topics, making them more direct and action-oriented. We broke down vague commands into actionable steps, for example, changing ‘Orient the pots’ to ‘Orient both potentiometers with the shafts facing down and lugs facing up’ so users know exactly what to do instead of having to guess.

Following the paramedic method, we cut out unnecessary words and moved technical details into separate info elements instead of cramming everything into massive sentences. Wire color information now appears as helpful notes after the main command rather than being embedded in confusing multi-clause sentences like "Solder the white, green, or yellow wire, depending on the type and brand of your humbucker, to the casing."

We made sure to use consistent terminology throughout, sticking with "potentiometer" in formal elements like titles and shortdescs while keeping commands clear and direct. The shortdescs got completely rewritten to be user-focused and explain what you'll actually accomplish - "Verify your wired circuit produces sound and responds to volume control before installing it in the guitar body" instead of vague phrases like "How to test the circuit by checking for sound". We also added context sections that explain why you're doing each task, not just what to do.

We also organized the information using progressive disclosure, putting the essential action in the command first, then adding clarifying details in info elements or substeps for novice users who need more guidance, while keeping expert paths concise. The prerequisite sections now clearly list what tools and materials users need upfront so they're not caught off guard mid-task, and we added stepresults to verification steps so users know what success looks like instead of just blindly following instructions.
